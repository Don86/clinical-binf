# Fundamentals - Variants and Inheritance

## Some Incredibly Basic Terminology

- A **variant** is a difference between an individual's genetic sequence and a reference sequence. Responsible for genetic diversity. Some variants are disease-causing. 
- **Germline variant** - A gene change in a reproductive cell (egg or sperm) that becomes incorporated into the DNA of every cell in the body of the offspring. A variant contained within the germline can be passed from parent to offspring, and is, therefore, hereditary. - _NCI Dictionary of Genetics Terms_ 
- **Somatic variants** are variants acquired in your lifetime, after conception. These will vary from cell to cell. 

## More Terminology About Variants

(I remember Jan saying that these are just loose categorizations)

- **CNV** - ...the genetic trait involving the number of copies of a particular gene present in the genome of an individual. Genetic variants, including insertions, deletions, and duplications of segments of DNA, are also collectively referred to as CNVs. CNVs account for a significant proportion of the genetic variation between individuals. Also called copy number variant.
