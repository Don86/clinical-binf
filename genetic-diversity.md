# Thoughts about Genetic Diversity

Generally speaking, the concepts of "diversity", or "variability", in any context, are about how many forms a single variable or aspect of interest can take. e.g. racial diversity means a higher number of races, phenotypic diversity means the different forms that a particular physical trait can take, such as how flowers can take on all kinds of different shapes and sizes and colours. This usually lends diversity well to single scalars like variance, Hamming distance, entropy-based measures, and etc.

But *genetic* diversity should go beyond this one-dimensional approach. It should encompass three pieces of information:

- time (what/how much has changed over a predefined time period?)
- How much? (how many nucleotide changes?)
- Where? (where does the variability occur?)

This is because "diversity", as we understand it from both the lay interpretation of the word, or, say, phenotypic diversity, is not quite the same as what we usually want to discuss when mentioning "genetic diversity" in particular. On a genome, a nucleotide site can only take on one of four values - or, under normal biological circumstances, one of two (an A can't mutate to a C). So "diversity" cannot just mean the maximum number of forms that a site can take - because the maximum number of forms is too low.
