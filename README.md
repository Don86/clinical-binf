# Scientific Stack for Bioinformatics

To the curious visitor: this is an archive of my notes, a haphazard accumulation of everything that I'm learning on my way to a bioinformatics/data science god-mode. 

A goodish introduction to cancer genomics at the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/cancer-genomics-overview).

### Quotable Quotes

> ...mathematicians and biologists seem to differ enormously in the manner in which their imaginations are employed. Most biologists will probably feel that this advantage is all on their side. They are introduced early to the immense variety of living things...at the time when mathematician seems to be dealing only with the barest abstractions, with lines and points...I can imagine no more beneficial change in scientific education than that which would allow each to appreciate something of the imaginative grandeur of the realms of thought explored by the other. - R.A.F, The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection (1930)

This seems useful.
