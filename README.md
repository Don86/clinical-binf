# Scientific Stack for Bioinformatics

To the curious visitor: this is an archive of my notes, a haphazard accumulation of everything that I'm learning on my way to a bioinformatics/data science god-mode. 

A goodish introduction to cancer genomics at the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/cancer-genomics-overview).

### Quotable Quotes

> ...mathematicians and biologists seem to differ enormously in the manner in which their imaginations are employed. Most biologists will probably feel that this advantage is all on their side. They are introduced early to the immense variety of living things...at the time when mathematician seems to be dealing only with the barest abstractions, with lines and points...I can imagine no more beneficial change in scientific education than that which would allow each to appreciate something of the imaginative grandeur of the realms of thought explored by the other. 
- R.A.F, The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection (1930)

> [Bertrand]'s method of attack, which is that in common use, consisted essentially in calculating the probability, P, that a certain character, x, of the observed facts would arise if the hypothesis tested were true. If P were very small, this would generally be considered as an indication that the hypothesis, H, was probably false, and vice versa. *Bertrand expressed the pessimistic view that no test of this kind could give reliable results.* (emphasis added)
- J. Neyman; E.S. Pearson, On The Problem of the Most Efficient Tests of Statistical Hypoheses (1933)

> ...statistics is the study of populations, or aggregates of individuals, rather than of individuals. Scientific theories which involve the properties of large aggregates of individuals...such as the Kinetic Theory of Gases, the Theory of Natural selection, or the chemical Theory of Mass Action, are essentially statistical arguments...until comparatively recent times, the vast majority of workers in this field appear to have had no other aim than to ascertain aggregate, or average, values. The variation itself was not an object of study, but was recognised rather as a troublesome circumstance which detracted from the value of the average. 
- R.A.F., Statistical Methods for Research Workers (5th Ed., 1934)

This seems useful.
