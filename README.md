# Scientific Stack for Bioinformatics

To the curious visitor: this is an archive of my notes, a haphazard accumulation of everything that I'm learning on my way to a bioinformatics/data science god-mode. 

Topics should encompass:

 - full stack dev skills. These will probably not just be science-specific. After all, it pays to have a few orthogonal skill sets, or at least conditionally independent.
 - human (cancer) genomics

This seems useful.
